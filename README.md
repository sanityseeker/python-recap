# Seminars materials with solutions for ["Introduction to Programming"](https://www.hse.ru/en/edu/courses/450828436) (HSE, 2021)

Seminars were conducted for the group "ИАД-2" by me, Denis Belyakov.

The content here is mostly based on:
  - incredible [Python Docs](https://docs.python.org),
  - MSU courses by Георгий Курячий ([web](http://uneex.org/LecturesCMC), [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6m3WI2mgZLj3LgNYWQNH6g/featured)),
  - a wonderful book ["Fluent Python, 2nd Edition", written by Luciano Ramalho](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/fluent-python-2nd/9781492056348/).
